# ToyProblems

My solutions to regular practice problems. I get many of my prompts from codewars.com, though I also draw upon Makersquare instruction resources and the occasional Stack Overflow post.

## Reviewing this Repo

Each prompt has its own .js file, which contains paraphrased instructions for the prompt along with my solution code.
