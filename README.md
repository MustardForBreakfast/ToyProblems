# ToyProblems

My solutions to regular practice problems. I get many of my prompts from codewars.com, though I also draw upon Makersquare instructional resources, the occasional Stack Overflow post, and the internet at large.

## Reviewing this Repo

Each prompt has its own .js file, which contains paraphrased instructions for the prompt along with my solution code. 

If you wish to check my work, the solution code in each file should be runnable in a standalone capacity, i.e. there should be no external dependencies required unless otherwise noted in the file itself.
